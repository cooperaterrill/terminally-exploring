# Overview
Heavy WIP terminal game with infinite random generation (basically minecraft). There are no goals right now.

# Quickstart
It's rust bro just run it (```cargo run --release```) in your terminal

# Notices
- Only tested on my mac, probably doesn't work anywhere else. Maybe linux if you're lucky.
- Your terminal may or may not support the custom colors this uses so if it shits itself try getting a better one that's not from the 1990's

# Controls
Arrow keys to move, q to quit, e to inventory.
